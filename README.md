# Strawberries BBQ Version 2 - React App

## About the Project

I created this Single Page Application to act as a digital business card for a family members BBQ business in the Chicago metro area. The site was intended to be used in conjunction with the companies established social media accounts to increase their market presence and help draw in potential clients through a more professional medium.

## What I learned

This was my second personal web development project and my first React project. This project gave me my initial experience with refactoring code from a previous version of this project made with simple HTML, CSS, JS and Bootstrap. I learned how to manage local state and global state, and make external calls. I enjoyed making individual and reusable components and see how they can really help out with creating templates to use in freelance work when building slight variations of different websites. I gained experience with using Google Firebase and its hosting features. I also used the Firestore feature to create a database to hold monthly event information and menu item descriptions so that they could be updated with ease. Lastly I gained experience with using the MailChimp API used to collect newsletter submission and to help facilitate distribution of newsletters for future events.
